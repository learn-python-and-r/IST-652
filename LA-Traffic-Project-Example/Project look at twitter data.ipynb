      "Message:  @jasontrost Key differences are: LA is consistently very bad at junctions (110/101/5, 405). LA has few options to avoid traffic (limited metro and few dedicated bus lanes). LA has sprawl &gt; density w no central area (Manhattan, Loop). Creates a situation where you’re stuck in traffic a lot\n",
